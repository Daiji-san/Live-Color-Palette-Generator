# Live-Color-Palette-Generator
This web application accesses the user's camera (with permission) and continuously analyzes the live video stream. Every second, it samples pixels from the video frame to determine the top five most dominant colors in the scene. It then displays these colors as a generated palette, along with their hex codes.
